Very bare basic rails tropo app, just to see how to make a simple tropo SMS or call.  To set yourself up, go to Tropo's
website and create an account, then make your first application.  From there, create ruby files under "Your Hosted Files",
preferably two different ones, that will be your handlers, and link them to your Application.  Be sure to set up a phone
number while you are in the Application.

Sample SMS handler:

    call $phonenumber, {
    :network => "SMS"}
   say $message

Sample Call handler:

call $phonenumber
say $message

The only files I added to this project were the text_controller.rb and a blank views/text/sendSMS.html.erb files to
send the message.  You'll need to add the token from your account and phone number to get anything to send.
